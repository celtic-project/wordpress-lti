This plugin allows WordPress to be integrated as a tool with on-line courses using the IMS Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) specification.

== Description ==
This *LTI Connector for WordPress* is a plugin which allows WordPress to act as an IMS LTI tool so that its blogs can be linked directly from a course in a VLE. LTI support can be found in most VLEs thereby enabling WordPress to be integrated with ease.  (A [companion plugin](http://www.spvsoftwareproducts.com/php/wordpress-lti-platform/) is also available which enables WordPress to act as an LTI platform.)
