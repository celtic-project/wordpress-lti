This plugin allows WordPress to be integrated as a tool with on-line courses using the 1EdTech (formerly IMS) [Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI)](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability) specification.

== Description ==
This *LTI Connector for WordPress* is a plugin which allows WordPress to act as a 1EdTech (formerly IMS) LTI tool so that its blogs can be linked directly from a course in a VLE. LTI support can be found in most VLEs thereby enabling WordPress to be integrated with ease.  (A [companion plugin](http://www.spvsoftwareproducts.com/php/wordpress-lti-platform/) is also available which enables WordPress to act as an LTI platform.)
